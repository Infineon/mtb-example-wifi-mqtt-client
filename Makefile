# Basic Configuration
################################################################################

# Type of ModusToolbox Makefile Options include:
#
# COMBINED    -- Top Level Makefile usually for single standalone application
# APPLICATION -- Top Level Makefile usually for multi project application
# PROJECT     -- Project Makefile under Application
#
MTB_TYPE=COMBINED

# Target board/hardware (BSP).
# To change the target, it is recommended to use the Library manager
# ('make library-manager' from command line), which will also update Eclipse IDE launch
# configurations.
TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439

# Name of application (used to derive name of final linked file).
#
# If APPNAME is edited, ensure to update or regenerate launch
# configurations for your IDE.
APPNAME=mtb-example-wifi-mqtt-client

# Name of toolchain to use. Options include:
#
# GCC_ARM -- GCC provided with ModusToolbox software
# ARM     -- ARM Compiler (must be installed separately)
# IAR     -- IAR Compiler (must be installed separately)
#
# See also: CY_COMPILER_PATH below
TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM

# Default build configuration. Options include:
#
# Debug -- build with minimal optimizations, focus on debugging.
# Release -- build with full optimizations
# Custom -- build with custom configuration, set the optimization flag in CFLAGS
#
# If CONFIG is manually edited, ensure to update or regenerate launch configurations
# for your IDE.
CONFIG=Debug

# Default value for CORE is CM4 for PSoC 6 MCU and CM7 for XMC7000
# You can change it to CM0P to port your application to CM0+.
# Uncomment the below line to use CM0+ core.
#
# CORE=CM0P

# If set to "true" or "1", display full command-lines when building.

# Enable optional code that is ordinarily disabled by default.
#
# Available components depend on the specific targeted hardware and firmware
# in use. In general, if you have
#
#    COMPONENTS=foo bar
#
# ... then code in directories named COMPONENT_foo and COMPONENT_bar will be
# added to the build
#
COMPONENTS=FREERTOS LWIP MBEDTLS SECURE_SOCKETS

# Like COMPONENTS, but disable optional code that was enabled by default.
DISABLE_COMPONENTS=

# By default the build system automatically looks in the Makefile's directory
# tree for source code and builds it. The SOURCES variable can be used to
# manually add source code to the build process from a location not searched
# by default, or otherwise not found by the build system.

# CY8CPROTO-062-4343W board shares the same GPIO for the user button (USER BTN1)
# and the CYW4343W host wake up pin. Since this example uses the GPIO for
# interfacing with the user button, the SDIO interrupt to wake up the host is
# disabled by setting CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE to '0'.
#
# If you wish to enable this host wake up feature, Comment DEFINES+=CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE=0.
# If you want this feature on CY8CPROTO-062-4343W, change the GPIO pin for USER BTN
# in design/hardware & Comment DEFINES+=CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE=0.
